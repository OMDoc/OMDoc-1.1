  Let $E$ be a set. A mapping of $E\times E$ is called a
  law of composition on $E$. The value $f(x,y)$ of $f$ for an ordered pair
  $(x,y)\in E\times E$ is called the composition of $x$ and $y$ under this 
  law. A set with a law of composition is called a magma.

  The composition of $x$ and $y$ is usually denoted by writing $x$ and $y$
  in a definite order and separating them by a characteristic symbol of the 
  law in question (a symbol which it may be agreed to omit). Among the 
  symbols most often used are $+$ and $.$, the usual convention being to omit the 
  latter if desired; with these symbols the composition of $x$ and $y$ is 
  written respectively as $x+y$, $x.y$ or $xy$. A law denoted by the symbol 
  $+$ is usually called {\em addition} (the composition $x+y$ beind called 
  the {\em sum} of $x$ and $y$) and we say that it is {\em written additively}; 
  a law denoted by the symbol . is usually called {\em multiplication} (the 
  composition $x.y=xy$ being called the {\em product} for $x$ and $y$) and we 
  say that it is {\em written multiplicatively}.

  In the general arguments of paragraphs 1 to 3 of this chapter we shall 
  generally use the symbols $\top$ and $\bot$ to denote arbitrary laws of 
  composition.

<omtext id="t3">
 <CMP>
  By an abuse of language, a mapping of a {\em subset} of $E\times E$ into $E$ 
  is sometimes called a law of composition {\em not everywhere defined} on $E$.

  <CMP>
   The mappings $(X,Y)\mapsto X\cup Y$ and $(X,Y)\mapsto X\cap Y$ are
  laws of composition on the set of subsets of a set $E$.

   On the set $\bf N$ of natural numbers, addition, multiplication, and 
   exponentiation are laws of composition (the compositions of $x\in{\bf N}$ and 
   $y\in{\bf N}$ under these laws being denoted respectively by $x+y$, $xy$, or 
   $x.y$ and $x^y$)  ({\em Set Theory}, III, $\P3$, no. 4).

   Let $E$ be a set; the mapping $(X,Y)\mapsto X\circ Y$ is a law of composition 
   on the set of subsets of $E\times E$ ({\em Set Theory}, II, $\P3$, no. 3, 
   Definition 6); the mapping $(f,g)\mapsto f\circ g$ is a law of composition on 
   the set of mappings from  $E$ into $E$ ({\em Set Theory}, II, $\P5$, no. 2).
