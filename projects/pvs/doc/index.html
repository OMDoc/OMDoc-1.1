<h1>An OMDoc interface to PVS</h1>

In this project we develop interface code for the <a href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com"
TARGET="_top">PVS</a> theorem prover. The project code is available by anonymous
<a href="http://www.mathweb.org/cvs.html">CVS</a> (path
<tt>omdoc/projects/pvs</tt>), and can viewed <a
href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/projects/pvs">here</a>.

<h2>Authors and Contact</h2>

<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kohlhase" TARGET="_top">Michael Kohlhase</a>
(Carnegie Mellon University; primary author and contact) and <a
href="http://www.csl.sri.com/users/owre">Sam Owre</a> (SRI International; PVS
consulting)

<h2>Components</h2>
<ul>
 <li> <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/projects/pvs/pp-omdoc.lisp">
       <tt>pp-omdoc.lisp</tt></a>: some pvs lisp code (based on the new release of 
      PVS) that exports formulae in OMDoc. It works on the internal (parsed and
       disambiguated  by PVS) version of the PVS data structures. 
<li> <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/projects/pvs/pvs.omdoc">
       <tt>pvs.omdoc</tt></a>
     defines the OpenMath symbols of the PVS language constructs.  
<li> <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/xsl/omdoc2pvs.xsl">
       <tt>omdoc2pvs.xsl</tt></a> a style sheet for transforming OMDoc into PVS
       syntax. 
<li> you can find the results of exporting the PVS prelude 
     <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/projects/pvs/prelude">here</a>
      This is correct OMDoc (wrt. to the local version of omdoc.dtd, maybe needs 
      update), and can partially be transformed back by the 
      <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/xsl/omdoc2pvs.xsl">
       <tt>omdoc2pvs.xsl</tt></a> a style sheet. For the
       first 3n+k theories n,k>4, this can be parsed back by PVS (I have not
       checked that the theories are equivalent).
</ul>
<h2>What is still lacking?</h2>

 (there is a better list at the end of 
  <a href="http://www.mathweb.org/src/mathweb/omdoc/projects/pvs/pp-omdoc.lisp">
   <tt>pp-omdoc.lisp</tt></a>)

<ul> 
<li> support for PVS proofs (as opposed to proof scripts in private
  elements). The idea is to output as much of the proof
  structures in PVS, as some kind of proof plan.
<li> support for theory instances (here I am waiting for Sam to provide me
  with a function; and for me to find some time to take up the work).
